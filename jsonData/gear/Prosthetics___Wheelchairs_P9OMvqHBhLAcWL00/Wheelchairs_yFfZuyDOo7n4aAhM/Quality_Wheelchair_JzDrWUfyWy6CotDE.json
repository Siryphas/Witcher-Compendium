    "description": "A work of solid craftsmanship, these light-weight wheelchairs are the sort you see in towns and cities. An elegant frame and slanted wheels allows them to tackle nearly any environment\nwith ease.\n\nEffect: While using a Quality Wheelchair, any reduction to SPD, Dodge/Escape and Athletics caused by a Critical Wound or pre-existing disability is negated. However, while using a Quality Wheelchair, any check involving swimming or climbing is made at a -1.\n\nAny attack made against a person in a wheelchair is directed toward them instead of the chair for gameplay purposes.",
