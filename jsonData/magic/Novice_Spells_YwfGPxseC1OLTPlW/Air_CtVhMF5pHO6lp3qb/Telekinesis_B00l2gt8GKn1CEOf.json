This allows you to lift objects, push objects, and to some extent hold objects. \nAny skill-based task you try to perform with Telekinesis, such as tripping a foe, maneuvering something through an obstacle course, or (god help you) swinging a sword, uses your Will and Spell Casting at a -3. \nComplex actions like picking locks, firing bows, and loading crossbows are incredibly difficult, taking a -5. \nIf you choose to throw something with telekinesis use your WILL stat instead of your BODY to calculate range.",
