    "description": "A Druid learns very quickly how to harvest magically potent plants and turn them into a powerful focus for their magic which connects them to the land around them. A Druid can take a day and make a Rite of Oak and Mistletoe check against a DC specific to the area in which they find themselves to harvest the necessary ingredients. If successful, the Druid creates a Staff which works only for the Druid.\nThis staff functions exactly as a Staff but its Focus value rises as they improve their Rite of Oak & Mistletoe value. Additionally, while the druid is carrying their staff, they gain benefits based on their Rite of Oak & Mistletoe value.",
