    "effect": "By weaving symbols in chalk and coal on an archway or door frame and placing a small fifth-essence-infused clay icon on the top of the entryway you create an invisible curtain. \nThis magical curtain records the faces of anyone who passes through and alerts you telepathically if anyone you designated when you cast the ritual pass through it.\nThe curtain keeps the recordings of the faces until the ritual ends, after which they are stored in the clay icon which can be viewed by someone with a Vigor Threshold of 1 or higher. These recordings remain as long as the icon remains intact. \nWhile the ritual is active, you can access the records at any time telepathically while within 100m. \nYou must also be within 100m for the Magical Guestbook to alert you to a designated person entering.",
