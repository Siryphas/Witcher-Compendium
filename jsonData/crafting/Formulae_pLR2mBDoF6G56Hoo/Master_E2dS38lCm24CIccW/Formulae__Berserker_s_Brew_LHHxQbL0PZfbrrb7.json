    "description": "<p><em>Some folks in Skellige use a mushroom called Mardroeme to whip themselves up into a frenzy. Guess this stuff was some mainland alchemist&rsquo;s attempt to copy that. Backfired a bit. Heard of more folks using it as a poison. A few drops in some noble&rsquo;s drink and suddenly their swinging left and right. Heh, hard to recover your reputation after ya put a fork in the Duchess of Attre.</em></p>\n<p>When consumed, a target must make an Endurance check at a DC: 16. If they fail, they must use their turn to attack the closest person. Each round, at the beginning of their turn, they can attempt another DC: 16 Endurance check. If they succeed, the frenzy subsides until their next turn, at which point they must make the Endurance check again or fall back into a frenzy.</p>",
