    "description": "DC: 16 Education\nFor many mages it's very useful to have a small animal at hand to run errands and deliver letters, but not as convenient to constantly by caring for a pet. This dilemma gave birth to the Crystal Skull, a crystalized animal skull, permeated with magic which can transform into a physical animal. Upon speaking the activation word, the skull transforms into the animal it came from (cat, dog, bird, or serpent). The animal responds to your mental commands as long as you are within 50m, and will act like a regular animal of its kind should you give it no commands. Upon death, the animal reverts to an inert crystal skull. The Crystal Skull can be recharged by performing the Crystal Skull Ritual using only 2 units of Fifth Essence and the inactive skull. The animal summoned from a skull is always the same animal.",
