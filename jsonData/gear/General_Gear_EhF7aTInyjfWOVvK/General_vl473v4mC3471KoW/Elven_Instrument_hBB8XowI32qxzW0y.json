    "description": "Made with ancient elven crafting techniques, this Lyre, Lute, or Flute carries a small amount of magic in it. WHen the user plays this instrument, the user can make a Performance check against the Resist Magic of a target who can hear their performance, to enthrall them. If they succeed, the target can only focus on the user and takes a -2 to any action that would draw their attention away from them. Each round, the user must use an action to continue playing and the target can use their action to attempt another Resist Magic roll to end the effect If they leave the area of the performance, the effect ends immediately.",
