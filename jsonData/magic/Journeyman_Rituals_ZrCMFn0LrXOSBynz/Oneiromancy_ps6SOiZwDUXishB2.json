A caster can perform the ritual alone.\nIt requires a Ritual Casting check to witness events that have occurred previously and a more difficult DC to witness events that are occurring at the moment. Oneiromancy can be detected by Mages using Magic Training.\nThe Oneiromancer can also guide a number of people equal to their Ritual Crafting skill value to share their enlightening dream. \nTo do this, the oneiromancer must make a bond with the people they want to enlighten. This requires the participants to answer a series of personal questions, as truthfully as possible. \nThe dream lasts for the duration of the ritual.",
