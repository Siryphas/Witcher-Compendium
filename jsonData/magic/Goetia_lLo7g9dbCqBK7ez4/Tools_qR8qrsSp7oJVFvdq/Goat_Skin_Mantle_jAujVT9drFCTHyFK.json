    "description": "A treated goat skin mantle that hangs around the shoulders and clasps at the front with bone toggles. \nGoat Skin Mantles have several unique effects when summoning various forms of demons and are used as a first line of defense by goetic practitioners. \nThe only person who benefits from the effects of a Goat Skin Mantle is the person wearing it.\n\n~Bes: Unless the summoner is wearing a Goat Skin Mantle, the bes will immediately try to possess them upon its summoning. This happens before anyone can take an action.\n\n~Casglydd: Unless the summoner is wearing a Goat Skin Mantle, the Casglydd will immediately try to use its Claw attack to drag them into the shadows where it will negotiate on its terms. This happens before anyone can take an action.\n\n~Mari Lwyd: Unless the summoner is wearing a Goat Skin Mantle, the mari Lwyd will assume that everything present in the building where the summoning takes place is part of the summoner’s offering.",
