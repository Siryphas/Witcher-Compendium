    "description": "A wooden box containing a set of iron markers, reference texts, maps, and historical records which help a character predict the flow of a battle. By taking 10 minutes, a character can lay out the battle ahead to the best of their knowledge and make a Tactics check at a DC set by the GM. If they succeed, they can ask the GM three of the following questions about the upcoming battle and the GM must answer truthfully:\n-What will the enemies' first move be?\n-What is our best approach to this battle?\n-Is there an element of the environment we can use to our benefit?\n-How will our enemy react to our plan?\n-Are there any aspects of the environment our enemy might use against us?\n-Is the enemy likely to have set up traps?",
