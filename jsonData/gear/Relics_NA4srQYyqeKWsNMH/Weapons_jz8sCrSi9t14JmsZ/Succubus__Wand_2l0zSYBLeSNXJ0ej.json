    "description": "Education DC: 20\n\nStory is, this staff used to belong to a succubus by the name of Nerys. Heh, now I’ve talked to a lotta mages—well, three, but who’s countin’—and they say lotsa monsters have their own magic, ‘specially the ones that came from the Conjunction. But they don’t have magic like we do—they can’t perform spells and whatnot. Lines up pretty well with what I’ve seen. \nStill, they say this Nerys was a powerful mage. Could cast any spell a sorceress might, and was real prideful about it. She’d travel her territory, showin’ off to other succubi and satyrs and whatnot. Heh, but that wasn’t enough for Nerys. She sneaks into Ban Ard where she beguiles a young sorcerer into makin’ her a staff. With that staff in her hand, Nerys became twice as powerful—she could control just about anyone. The most chaste knight, the stuffiest priests, even women from what I hear, heh…. ‘course, the story don’t end there. \nOne day, Nerys encounters this young herder, out in the woods looking for his lost sheep. Folk’d warned him not to wander far, but he just couldn’t afford to lose that sheep. The poor boy hikes from sunup to noon just lookin’ for that damn sheep, and pretty soon he winds up near Nerys’ home. Itchin’ for a bit of fun and spottin’ an easy target, Nerys comes down from her ruins and greets the herder. ‘Course the kid’s scared outta his wits, but pretty damn tempted to stay. Can’t blame the poor lad—doubt my will’d been any stronger. Nerys invites the fellow up for a roll in the hay, but he finds enough wit to insist that he’s got a wife at home who’ll skin him alive if he does. Nerys ain’t pleased, of course. She weaves all manner of enchantment around the boy, turnin’ his mind to mush and, ahem, other parts to diamond. ‘pon returnin’ home the lad’s exhausted and he’s got one foot in the grave already. \nAnd the fella’s right. His wife, she don’t take kindly to this at all. But the boy tells how he’d been tricked by all sorts of foul magics—which of course, he had been. So his wife, she gathers up the bits of her dowry—a few silver pieces and a handsome necklace—and goes to the local blacksmith to get ‘em made into a silver hair pin. Night falls. Nerys, hungry again after her romp with the farmer, is surprised to find some farm girl offerin’ herself up. But the girl pays her compliments, so Nerys doesn’t think much on it. Then, just as the fun’s beginnin’ our farm girl takes down her hair and drives her silver hair pin into Nerys’ heart. ‘Course Nerys’s shocked, since no mortal’s been able to resist her for years. Heh, never bet against a woman with murder in her heart. Deed done, the farmer’s wife returned home, takin’ Nerys’ staff as a trophy of her victory.\n- Rodolf Kazmer",
