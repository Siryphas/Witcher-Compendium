If these points are expended the target dies. \nIf a limb is broken off, either with a DC:14 Physique check or 5 points of damage, the target is treated as if that limb was dismembered.\nIf the head is snapped off, the target dies. \nGluing pieces back onto a compressed figurine doesn’t reattach the limb. \nAfter a target is uncompressed they are stunned until they make a successful Stun save.",
