    "description": "DC: 18\nCrafted by the elves and carried throughout the Continent with elven scouting parties, these tightly woven white ropes are imbued with magic which allows them to move with the will of their holder. The rope can twist and cling to people reaching out for it, tie itself around objects that it is laid on, and retract back to the holder. While the rope is capable of tying itself around people, it never does this fast enough to grapple a resisting creature. When climbing with this rope, you gain a +5 to Athletics made to climb. Finally, the rope, despite its delicate nature, is nigh unbreakable, able to support 300kg of weight and take 50 points of damage.",
