    "notes": "<h1><strong>Estate</strong></h1>\n<p>A Noble&rsquo;s estate is a nice, well-established property furnished with all the luxuries befitting a&nbsp;nobleperson. Its layout can be determined (within reason) by the player but once the layout&nbsp;has been established, only upgrading the estate can change that layout. A Noble&rsquo;s estate is&nbsp;staffed by a majordomo (Scholar), who manages the home, and a number of servants (Laborers)&nbsp;equal to the Noble&rsquo;s Estate value times two, who take care of all chores and tend to&nbsp;the Noble. They will not leave the estate nor enter combat for the Noble, unless convinced.&nbsp;Certain additions will add specific servants to your estate. These servants do not count&nbsp;against the total granted by your Estate value.</p>\n<h2><strong>Additions:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Barracks:</strong> Adding Barracks to your estate not only adds&nbsp;a brick building attached to your estate but also gives you&nbsp;access to ten Guards (use Bandit Stats). These guards live in the barracks and follow your orders.&nbsp;They will go into combat to defend you or your estate and&nbsp;will report anything strange to you or your majordomo.&nbsp;Their duty is to the estate and they will not leave it to fight&nbsp;elsewhere. If you choose this addition again, you gain five&nbsp;more guards.</li>\n<li><strong>Greenhouse:</strong> Adding a Greenhouse to your estate&nbsp;gives you access to a number of plant-based Components.&nbsp;When you build your Greenhouse, you can select&nbsp;four Everyday/Common-rarity Components and&nbsp;two Poor-rarity Components that could be grown in a&nbsp;Greenhouse. Every month your Greenhouse generates&nbsp;ten units of each of these. If you find a plant component&nbsp;while away you can return to your estate and cultivate it&nbsp;in your Greenhouse, causing it to provide the same number&nbsp;of units per month. You can cultivate a maximum of&nbsp;ten individual Components in a single Greenhouse. Your&nbsp;Greenhouse is managed by a Gardener with a Base 15&nbsp;Wilderness Survival.</li>\n<li><strong>Hunting Grounds:</strong> Adding a Hunting Ground to&nbsp;your estate adds a large area of wilderness within a day&rsquo;s&nbsp;travel that is stocked with game animals. By spending&nbsp;time hunting in your Hunting Grounds, you can generate&nbsp;beast bones, feathers, and leather (which is cured by&nbsp;your Huntsmaster). For every hour spent hunting, you&nbsp;generate 1d6 units of each component (maximum 3d6).&nbsp;Your Hunting Ground is managed by a Huntsmaster with&nbsp;a Base 15 Wilderness Survival.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal Physician:</strong> Adding a Personal Physician to&nbsp;your estate gives you access to a physician who will treat&nbsp;you and your guests at no cost. This Physician counts a&nbsp;Scholar with a Healing Hands Base of 15.</li>\n<li><strong>Secret Rooms:</strong> Each time you add Secret Rooms to&nbsp;your estate you create two hidden rooms and two hidden&nbsp;passages. A hidden passage can connect up to three existing&nbsp;rooms. A DC:16 Awareness check is required to spot&nbsp;the entrances of these secret instalments and each one has&nbsp;a lock that opens with a special key in your possession.&nbsp;You can have this key replicated for free. If someone spots&nbsp;the secret room, they can attempt a DC:20 Pick Lock&nbsp;check to open the entrance.</li>\n<li><strong>Security:</strong> Adding security to your estate improves the&nbsp;locks on all doors and windows. These locks now have a&nbsp;Pick Lock DC of 18 rather than the standard DC of 15.&nbsp;This does not affect the locks on Secret Rooms or Torture&nbsp;Chambers. Taking this addition a second time raises the&nbsp;Pick Lock DC to 20.</li>\n<li><strong>Torture Chamber:</strong> Adding a Torture Chamber to&nbsp;your estate creates a subterranean chamber closed off by&nbsp;a DC:18 lock on the outside of the room. The room is&nbsp;furnished with torture devices and five cages locked with&nbsp;DC:18 locks. While using this room, the user gains a +3 to&nbsp;Intimidation but deals 2d6 damage to the target for each&nbsp;attempt. If using Verbal Combat, the Torture Chamber&nbsp;grants a +2 bonus to the benefits gained from torture and&nbsp;torment. The Torture Chamber is maintained by a Torturer&nbsp;with a Base 15 in Intimidation.</li>\n<li><strong>Workshop:</strong> Adding a Workshop to your estate creates&nbsp;a small building that not only contains all the tools required&nbsp;to perform a craft but also grants a bonus of +2 to&nbsp;any crafting checks made within. When you build your&nbsp;Workshop, you must decide which form of crafting it is&nbsp;dedicated to. Multiple Workshops can be built in your estate,&nbsp;each with their own specialization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Visiting Your Estate</strong></h3>\n<p>As a Noble, your estate can be&nbsp;an amazingly powerful source&nbsp;of resources, power, and information.&nbsp;That being said, all the&nbsp;functions of an estate require&nbsp;you to be physically present on&nbsp;your estate. You may choose to&nbsp;visit your estate often or perhaps&nbsp;push to make your estate&nbsp;the base of operations for your&nbsp;party.</p>",
