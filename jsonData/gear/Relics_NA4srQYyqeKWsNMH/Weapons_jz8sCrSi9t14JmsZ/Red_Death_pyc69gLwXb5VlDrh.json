    "description": "Education DC: 16\n\nFirst outbreak of catriona devastated the Continent and killed thousands of people. I just barely avoided the plague and I think it’s only up to whatever divine bein’s may be out there. I knew ten or twenty folks who weren’t so lucky. Death by the plague’s probably the worst death short of bein’ eaten alive by some necrophage. After a while it came clear to folk that the surest way to keep everyone from dyin’ of the plague was to wipe out all them as were showin’ symptoms. Kill ‘em off and burn the bodies and you’ll stop the plague. Heh, wasn’t too popular among the folks who were already infected. But it’s not like the gentry give a damn.\nOne military surgeon from Gwendieth took this to heart and got a special crossbow, to kill off infected folk without riskin’ the plague himself. Folk say the ’Executioner of Gwendieth,’ as they’d call him, commissioned this crossbow at a staggerin’ draw weight—five hundred and fifty kilos! Put a bolt through a skull and out the other side. Heh, people’re split as to whether he did it to put people out of their misery easy or to make the job quicker. The Executioner started purgin’ Gwendieth one street at a time, with a quiver the size of a ploughin’ barrel and mask to keep out the plagued air and the stench of death. \nProblem is, the plague’s pretty hard to suss out in the early stages. Hard to figure who’s freshly ill and who’s just starvin’. Coroners guess’d he killed at least a few healthy folk in purgin’ the city. Legend says the crossbow killed so many people over the course of those few months that it started to bind the pain and sorrow of all the people it killed to itself. Guess evil’s evil and magic don’t believe the ends justify the means. Folk say the Executioner of Gwendieth started hearin’ voices in his sleep and havin’ fitful nightmares of all sorts.\nAfter two months the nightmares started turnin’ into delusions. He’d see faces in dark corners and hear screams in empty buildin’s. Three months later the plague was under control but the surgeon turned-executioner was a wreck. He couldn’t stand the sight of the crossbow anymore. Called it the Red Death. Some folk say he left it in a cave in the deep wilderness and disappeared into the mountains, never to be seen again. Some say the commander of his unit found him in one of the derelict houses, crossbow at his feet an’ a bolt through his skull.\n- Rodolf Kazmer",
