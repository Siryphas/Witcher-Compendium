    "description": "Simple in make and function, these prostheses aren’t fancy, but they get the job done. These might include simplistic wooden hands or peg prostheses, or slightly more refined\ndesigns where gravity is used to maneuver the joints.\n\nEffect: While wearing a Basic Prosthesis, the limb has a full range of mobility and function, and any reduction to SPD is negated. Due to its lack of fine motor function, all attack and defense checks made with a prosthetic arm are made at a -3. In the case of a Basic Prosthetic Leg, all Dodge/Escape checks are made at a -1. \n\nAdditionally, a Basic Prosthesis cannot be used to channel Chaos. Any attack made against a prosthetic limb is redirected towards its wearer for gameplay purposes.",
