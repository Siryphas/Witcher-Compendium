But this stuff’s good if ya need to burn through a lock or ya need a makeshift weapon.\n\nAcid Solution does 2d6 damage to any living creature it is thrown on and does 1d6/2 ablation damage to weapons and armor.\nThrowing it is an Athletics attack with a range of BODYx2m, and the acid splatters in a 2m cone directly away from where it lands.",
