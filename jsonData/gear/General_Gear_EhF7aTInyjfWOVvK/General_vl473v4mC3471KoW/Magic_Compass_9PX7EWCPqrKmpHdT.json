    "description": "An enchanted compass which can point the user towards an object they have a clear and accurate mental image of. By taking an action, a character holding a Magic Compass can make a Resist Coercion check at a DC set by the GM to clear their mind of any distractions and visualize an object they've seen before. If the character succeeds, the compass points in the direction of the item they were thinking of. If they fail, it points in the direction of some other thing the holder desires.",
