A fisstech addict’s a scary thing—not an ounce of fear or dignity when the cravings catch ‘em.\n\nFisstech sends those who snort it or rub it on their gums into a euphoric trance-like state. It is often used as an anesthetic, as it numbs pain. It is highly addictive. After each use, make an Endurance check at a DC: 18. If you fail, you become addicted.",
