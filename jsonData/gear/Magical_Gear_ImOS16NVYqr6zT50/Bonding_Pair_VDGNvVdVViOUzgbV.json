    "description": "DC: 16 Education\nThese ornate silver rings are magically bonded to each other, allowing the wearers to communicate over great distances and sense when their partner is in danger.\nThis item always comes in a set of 2 rings. When a wearer turns the ring in a specific sequence around their finger, they can speak a few words, roughly twenty, to be carried on the wind to the wearer of the other ring. The message always reaches its destination in less than a day, but the exact amount of time depends on distance and is left up to the GM.\nAdditionally, the rings vibrate when one of the wearers is in mortal danger regardless of the distance between the two.",
