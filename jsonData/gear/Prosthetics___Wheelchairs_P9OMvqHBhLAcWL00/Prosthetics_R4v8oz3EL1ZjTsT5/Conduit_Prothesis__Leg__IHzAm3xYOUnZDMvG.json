    "description": "Built by Barend Anselberg and Elgan of Verden, the Conduit Prosthesis is the culmination of Barend’s prosthetic research put into the realm of practicality by Elgan’s many magical theories. Though beautiful in its design and use as a powerful focus, it proved insufficient for their original goal of creating a prosthesis for witchers, but has since been replicated for use by mages.\n\nEffect: While wearing a Conduit Prosthesis, the limb has a full range of mobility and function, and any reduction to SPD is negated. A Conduit Prosthesis can be used to channel Chaos through magical sigils carved into the length, inlaid with optima matter and fifth essence and acts as a Focus (2) with the Greater Focus effect. \n\nAny attack made against a prosthetic limb is redirected towards its wearer for gameplay purposes.",
