    "description": "<p>Witcher medallions are small pendants made of silver that hang around a witcher's neck. When they come within 20m of any monster, curse, or spell that is currently being cast, the medallion vibrates almost imperceptibly, alerting the witcher.</p>\n<p>Witcher Medallions are relatively easy to craft since they are primarily just cast silver. But they must be made in a specific way and must be crafted by a mage. A mage can craft a medallion with a unit of silver but afterward they must take it to a Place of Power to absorb magic. After being left at that Place of Power for an hour it will function as a witcher medallion. No other benefits can be gained from the Place of Power while priming.</p>",
