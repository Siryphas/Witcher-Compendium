    "description": "A specifically crafted doll which is infused with dark magic to replicate a specific Low Danger Hex. A character holding a Black Magic Doll can take a full round action to cut their hand (dealing 10 HP Damage), bleed onto the doll, and roll a Curse Weaving check against the Resist Magic of a target they truly hate. If the character succeeds, they inflict the Hex associated with the doll on the target.",
