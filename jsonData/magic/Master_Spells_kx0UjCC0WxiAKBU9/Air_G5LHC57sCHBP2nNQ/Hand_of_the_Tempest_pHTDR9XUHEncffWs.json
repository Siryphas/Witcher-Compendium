Upon hitting the ground, the target and anything it hits takes 7d6 bludgeoning damage to the torso and are knocked prone. \nAlternatively, with a powerful gust you can flood a 14m cone with powerful wind.\nAnyone in this area who fails a Reposition check or could not escape the area of the spell with their reposition is knocked back 14m and takes ramming damage if they hit anything as they fly. \nFinally, you can manipulate an object up to 1000kg as though you were holding it in your hand.",
