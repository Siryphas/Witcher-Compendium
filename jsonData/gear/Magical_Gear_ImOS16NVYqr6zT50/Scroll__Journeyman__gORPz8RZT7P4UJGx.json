    "description": "DC: 14 Education\nSpell formulae are used by teachers of magic to ensure their pupils understand the underlying theories and risks involved with casting particular spells. While many lay people believe these papers to hold magical potential (and many are sold as such), no spell can be cast through a spell formula. When using a spell formula, you gain +2 to your skill check to learn a specific spell, invocation, hex, sign, or ritual.",
