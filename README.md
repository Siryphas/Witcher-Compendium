# Witcher-Complete-Compendium
Features a complete collection of all official content from the books and DLC PDFs. 
It's all there.
Includes a huge library of images, including Bestiary images and custom icons made for Magic, Runes & Glyphs, and Witcher gear.
CDProjecktRED and R. Talsorian Games are the sole owners of the system, rules, and artwork. 

With the new version of Witcher TRPG for Foundry, the Complete Compendium will no longer be integrated into the system module due to licensing issues. Please direct Issues for the Compendium here. 
Please note that I am not a coder; if you have issues with the system or the way the system works, please direct your Issues to https://github.com/witchertrpg-foundryvtt/TheWitcherTRPG. I only modify the template elements provided by the system authors.
Updates to the Compendium will come as new features are added to the system module, though it may take some time to edit everything.

This Compendium module now includes Top-Down tokens created by Greg Bruni. 
His content can be found on his website: https://www.gregbrunicreations.com/
