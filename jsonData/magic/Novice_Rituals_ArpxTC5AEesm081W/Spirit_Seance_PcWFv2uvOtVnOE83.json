The seance brings the soul back as a specter with the sentience of the original person. \nThe specter retains all memories, including the memory of their death, and can be spoken with at its burial site. \nThe specter cannot be sent back to the realm of the dead except at its own choice, or by killling it. \nThe Seance will summon the spirits of anyone of the same bloodline within 20m so using this spell in family crypts is not advised.",
