While this makes them incredibly loyal it can sometimes be difficult if you try to use them for your own gain as they will expect you to act in accordance with the doctrine and teachings of their deity.<br>Any time you give a truly strange or uncharacteristic command to your apostles, you must make a Word of God check at a DC set by the GM. If you fail, your apostles will still carry out the command but a seed of doubt has been planted in their minds. On the third consecutive time you are forced to make this check and you fail your apostles become disillusioned and leave you. If your third failure is a fumble your apostles will brand you as a heretic or a false messiah and attack you.<br>Examples of conflicts of interest include: commanding followers of Melitele to torture or kill seemingly undeserving people, commanding followers of the Eternal Fire to save or aid Elderfolk or mages, commanding followers of the Great Sun to go against the word of the Nilfgaardian Emperor, etc. In most cases, the teachings of each deity is fairly clearly spelled out in their description but if there is any confusion the GM has final say on what is and isn&rsquo;t a conflict of interest.</p>",
