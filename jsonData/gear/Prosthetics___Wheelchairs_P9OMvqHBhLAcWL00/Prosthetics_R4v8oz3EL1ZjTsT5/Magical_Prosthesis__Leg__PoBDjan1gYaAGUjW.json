    "description": "Craftsmanship and solid materials make these prostheses a comfortable fit for most lifestyles. More anatomical in their design and inlaid with simple enchantments, they are able to withstand high impact and perform complex motor functions.\n\nEffect: While wearing a Magical Prosthesis, the limb has a full range of mobility and function, and any reduction to SPD is negated. Additionally, a Magical Prosthesis cannot be used to channel Chaos. \nAny attack made against a prosthetic limb is redirected towards its wearer for gameplay purposes.",
