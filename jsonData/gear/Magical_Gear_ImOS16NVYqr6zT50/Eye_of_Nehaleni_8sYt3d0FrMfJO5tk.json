    "description": "DC: 16 Education\nEyes of Nehaleni are rare magical objects that have begun to resurface in the last decade. These round stone tablets have inscription of a complex variation of the symbol of Nehaleni, the Nordling goddess of fate & illusion. Holding the tablet aloft and calling to the goddess allows a person to attempt to dispel illusions.\nBy taking an action, you can make a Spell Casting check with a +4 bonus against the original check made to create the illusion or a DC set by the GM. If you succeed, the illusion ends. The Eye of Nehaleni does not require you to spend any stamina to dispel an illusion.\nOf course, the resurgence of the Eyes have also led to a new market for fake Eyes of Nehaleni, so take what you hear at the Novigrad market with a grain of salt.",
